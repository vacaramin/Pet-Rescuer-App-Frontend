We are using Redux and Redux-Sagas in our project and handle business logic using them. If you are using Redux, then there must be action, reducers, saga, and services files that can be put here.

In stores, you can create an actions folder and you can store different types of actions in this folder. You can do the same as reducer, saga, and for services.
